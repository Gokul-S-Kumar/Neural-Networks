# Neural-Networks
## This repo contains notebooks and materials created in due course of learning Decision Trees.
### File details
1. Neural Networks.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the NN model built from scratch and trained using the Breast Cancer dataset. It also also contains the cross-verification of the model thus built using sklearn MPClassifier and a Sequential model using Tensorflow-Keras.
2. breast_cancer.csv: The Breast cancer dataset.
